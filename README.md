# Lotka-Volkerra-Model-m
In this proyect i used octave for show the solution of this model
	model.m 		-is the principal script, in this is implemented all of functions to resolve the equations
	gen_t.m 		-there is the function where "t" is generated
	analitic_laplace.m	-is where the analitic solution of the linealized model is implemented
